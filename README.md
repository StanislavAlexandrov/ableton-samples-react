# ableton-samples

A very simple site that displays all .WAV, .MP3 and .AIFF samples used in an Ableton Live project.

Let's say you have a lot of old sample folders on your hard drive that you do not plan on using anymore and would like to delete to save up space. What if some of the files were in an older track that you did not do 'save and collect' for? Firing up Ableton takes too long, so this site may be helpful to quickly check if that's the case.

Select one .ALS file (Ableton Live project file) and all samples used in the project will be displayed.
